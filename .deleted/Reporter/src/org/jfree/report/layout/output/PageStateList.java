 * The ReportState list stores a report states for the beginning of every page. The list

 * <p/>
 * Important: This list stores page start report states, not arbitary report states. These
 * ReportStates are special: they can be reproduced by calling processPage on the report.
 * <p/>
 * Internally this list is organized as a list of WeakReferenceLists, where every
 * WeakReferenceList stores a certain number of page states. The first 20 states are
 * stored in an ordinary list with strong-references, so these states never get
 * GarbageCollected (and so they must never be restored by reprocessing them). The next
 * 100 states are stored in 4-element ReferenceLists, so if a reference is lost, only 4
 * states have to be reprocessed. All other states are stored in 10-element lists.
