     * The implementor must ensure that <tt>sgn(compare(minX, minY)) == -sgn(compare(minY,
     * x))</tt> for all <tt>minX</tt> and <tt>minY</tt>.  (This implies that
     * <tt>compare(minX, minY)</tt> must throw an exception if and only if
     * <tt>compare(minY, minX)</tt> throws an exception.)<p>
     * <p/>
     * The implementor must also ensure that the relation is transitive:
     * <tt>((compare(minX, minY)&gt;0) &amp;&amp; (compare(minY, z)&gt;0))</tt> implies
     * <tt>compare(minX, z)&gt;0</tt>.<p>

     * Finally, the implementer must ensure that <tt>compare(minX, minY)==0</tt> implies

     * <tt>z</tt>.<p>
     * <p/>
     * It is generally the case, but <i>not</i> strictly required that

     * comparator that violates this condition should clearly indicate this fact.

     * are inconsistent with equals."
